Hi! I am an MEng student at MIT in the <a href="https://caml.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Clinical and Applied Machine Learning Group</a>, advised by <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/" target="_blank">Prof. John Guttag</a>. 
I am broadly interested the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, representation learning and its application to healthcare. I previously received my B.S. in Computer Science from MIT in 2023.
