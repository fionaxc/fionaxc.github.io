Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University. My current research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and representation learning and their applications to healthcare and medical imaging. My work is supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank"> NSF Graduate Research Fellowship </a>.

I previously completed my B.S and M.Eng in Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I was advised by <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/" target="_blank">Prof. John Guttag</a>.  In the past, I have worked on clinical informatics problems using traditional statistical machine learning approaches for tasks like clinical trial recruitment and probabilistic phenotyping.
